## Welcome to an Analysis of the Corona Journey in Germany

This repository prepares all the analysis for a written article on Medium. You can find it by using the following link:

## This repo contains the following elements

1. A data directory
This directory is currently empty since the data I used is a bit to big for uploading. 
You can find the data on Kaggle using the following link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/covid19-tracking-germany?select=covid_de_vaccines.csv

You can download this as a zip file. Basically you will have 3 different files:
  - covid_de.csv
  - covid_de_vaccines.csv
  - data/demographics_de.csv

2. A Jupyter Notebook

Within this Notebook I did all the analysis I used for the medium article. Since this follows the same structure as the article it will answer you the following questions:
  - Which were the worst times for Germany during Corona?
  - How did the virus hit Germany in total?
  - How is vaccination progressing in Germany?
  - Which vaccines are preferred in Germany?
  - How many cases will we have at the end of July?


3. A pics directory
This directory just contains the pictures which I extracted from the Jupyter Notebook to put them into the medium article.

4. A `requirements.txt` file
This file contains all the packages you need to run this Notebook on your local machine.
Just use the following `pip` to install the packages in you virtual in environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
